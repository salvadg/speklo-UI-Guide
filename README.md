# speklo-UI-Guide
### Rough design guide to help my development process flow better. But I'm not a UI/UX person. Just a person that tries to create things.

This rough draft that will be updated as I flesh out this project unless I forget.
Is this even how a style guide should be? probably not.  Why am I talking to myself? I'm the only one working on this project.
